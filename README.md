# DynamicOptimizationData
Data Repository for Experiments on Highly-Dynamic Communication Network Optimization

This repository is used to provide additional data for the publication "On the Automated and Reactive Optimization of Highly-Dynamic Communication Network Infrastructures" in the Journal of Universal Computer Science.
In the directory "raw", the raw data is provided for the experiments, each as *.csv file for inputing it into data processing tools.
The directory "pdf" contains an edited version of the raw data as *.pdf file, where all the data is typeset using LaTeX.
